# MongoDB Atlas Configuration (For Production Deployment)
# DO NOT use in development - keep local MongoDB for dev

# Connection String
MONGO_URL_ATLAS="mongodb+srv://hsarhan_db_user:DB%4037759699@pedotg.oaffcd1.mongodb.net/?appName=PedOTG"

# Note: Password special character @ is URL-encoded as %40
# Original password: DB@37759699

# To switch to Atlas for deployment:
# 1. Replace MONGO_URL in /app/backend/.env with MONGO_URL_ATLAS value
# 2. Ensure your Atlas cluster has the app's IP whitelisted (or use 0.0.0.0/0 for all IPs)
# 3. Restart the backend service
