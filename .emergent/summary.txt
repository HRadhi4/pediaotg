<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to enhance the Pediatrics on the go medical calculator application.

Initial feature requests for this session were:
1.  Complete the Growth Chart feature with plotting and save-to-gallery functionality.
2.  Redesign the Growth Chart based on WHO/CDC standards, including age in months/years, optional measurements, and Z-score interpretation.
3.  Refine the Growth Chart UI by making plotting dots smaller and simplifying the age input.
4.  Correct the Blood Pressure calculator in the Children's section to accurately reflect Harriet Lane data structure and integrate PALS formulas.
5.  Fix a navigation bug where sub-pages did not open at the top.
6.  Redesign the Approaches page in the Children's Dashboard, adding content from a provided PDF.
7.  Replace the offline OCR engine from Tesseract.js to PaddleOCR (Pivoted to server-side Tesseract).

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (This Session):
1.  Replace all application icons with a specific free open-source pack: .
2.  Unify the size and styling of the navigation bar across all pages.
3.  Redesign the Children > CPR page to be more user-friendly and less colorful, based on the PALS 2025 algorithm.
4.  Iteratively adjust the design based on feedback:
    -   Make icons thicker.
    -   Adjust the color scheme of the CPR page, first adding more color, then simplifying it.
    -   Make calculated values on the CPR page stand out, finally settling on red.
    -   Replace the Glucose Infusion Rate (GIR) icon with a glucose meter icon.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is stable. The agent has successfully completed a major UI overhaul based on user requests. All icons across the application (widgets, navigation bars) in , , and  have been replaced with a consistent set from . These icons are managed through a new centralized component, .

The navigation bars have been standardized for a uniform look and feel. The CPR page within the Children's Dashboard has been completely redesigned for a cleaner, more intuitive layout, with multiple iterative refinements to its color scheme and icon thickness based on user feedback.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent finished a comprehensive, app-wide replacement of all icons with the  pack. It has visually confirmed the changes on the landing page and the Children's dashboard. The last step of this task is to verify the NICU dashboard.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no known bugs or blocking issues.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1:** Verify the NICU Dashboard Icons (P0)
    -   **Where to resume:** The agent's last action was taking a screenshot of the Children's dashboard after the final icon update. The next step is to take a screenshot of the NICU dashboard to confirm the new  icons are rendered correctly there as well.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** Final confirmation that the sitewide icon update is complete and consistent across all three main views.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something:** None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**

-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   (P1) **User Notification on OCR Pivot:** Inform the user that their original request for **PaddleOCR** was attempted but failed due to high resource usage. Explain that a server-side **Tesseract OCR** was implemented as a stable and functional alternative. (This was deferred by the user).
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   (P2) **Refactor Monolithic Components:** The core page files ( and ) are extremely large and should be broken down into smaller, single-responsibility components.
    -   (P3) **Minor Linting Cleanup:** Address minor linting errors in legacy files like .

**Completed work in this session**
-   Replaced all  icons and old custom SVGs with a unified set from the  pack.
-   Created a new central component  to manage all application icons.
-   Unified the navigation bar styling and icon sizes across , , and .
-   Completely redesigned the CPR page in  with a cleaner, minimalist UI based on PALS 2025 guidelines.
-   Iteratively refined the icon thickness and CPR page color scheme (highlighting calculated values in red) based on user feedback.
-   Fixed a Droplets is not defined crash in .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1: Minor Linting Errors**
    -   **Debug checklist:** Run  on .
    -   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** Low-priority code hygiene. Does not affect functionality.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** None
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS, .
-   **UI:** Replaced  icons with custom inline SVG React components.
-   **State Management:** , .
-   **Component Architecture:** Centralized all SVG icons into a single, reusable  component, replacing disparate implementations.
-   **DOM Manipulation:** Heavy modification of JSX within monolithic components to achieve UI redesigns.

**key DB schema**
-   No database is used in this application.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : **New file.** Contains all the SVG icons sourced from  as individual React components.
-   : Heavily modified to replace widget/nav icons and completely redesign the  component.
-   : Modified to replace widget and navigation icons with the new .
-   : Modified to replace navigation icons for consistency.
-   : The user-specified source for all new icons.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **** and **** remain monolithic and complex. Refactoring them into smaller, manageable components is critical for future maintainability.

**key api endpoints**
-   : For online OCR with Gemini.
-   : For offline OCR with server-side Tesseract.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   Your immediate task is to visually verify the NICU dashboard. The previous agent completed a sitewide icon replacement and confirmed it on two of the three main pages. The NICU page is the last one to check.
-   The user is highly focused on visual details. Use screenshots to verify UI changes and be prepared for iterative feedback on styling (e.g., icon thickness, colors).
-   All application icons are now managed in . Any future icon changes should be made in this central file.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-    (updated by the agent)
-    (generated by the testing agent)
