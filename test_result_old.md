  - Shows "With Feed" (IV + Feed): Includes both IV dextrose and feed carbohydrate contribution
  - Target range reference: 4-8 mg/kg/min (preterm: 6-8, term: 4-6)
- **Total Calories Summary** still shows breakdown (Dextrose | Feed | TPN)

### Files Modified:
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/subscription/PricingPage.jsx`
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/NICUCalculator.jsx`

### Testing Required:
1. Pricing page - verify Priority Support removed and buttons aligned
2. NICU Fluid Calculator - enter sample data and verify GIR calculation with and without feed
3. PayPal payment flow - already tested working via curl
